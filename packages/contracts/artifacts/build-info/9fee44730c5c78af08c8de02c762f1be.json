@dev Contract module that helps prevent reentrant calls to a function.\n Inheriting from `ReentrancyGuard` will make the {nonReentrant} modifier\n available, which can be applied to functions to make sure there are no nested\n (reentrant) calls to them.\n Note that because there is a single `nonReentrant` guard, functions marked as\n `nonReentrant` may not call one another. This can be worked around by making\n those functions `private`, and then adding `external` `nonReentrant` entry\n points to them.\n TIP: If EIP-1153 (transient storage) is available on the chain you're deploying at,\n consider using {ReentrancyGuardTransient} instead.\n TIP: If you would like to learn more about reentrancy and alternative ways\n to protect against it, check out our blog post\n https://blog.openzeppelin.com/reentrancy-after-istanbul/[Reentrancy After Istanbul]."},"fullyImplemented":true,"id":1002,"linearizedBaseContracts":[1002],"name":"ReentrancyGuard","nameLocation":"1048:15:6","nodeType":"ContractDefinition","nodes":[{"constant":true,"id":939,"mutability":"constant","name":"NOT_ENTERED","nameLocation":"1843:11:6","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":1002,"src":"1818:40:6","stateVariable":true,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint256","typeString":"uint256"},"typeName":{"id":937,"name":"uint256","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"1818:7:6","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_uint256","typeString":"uint256"}},"value":{"hexValue":"31","id":938,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":true,"kind":"number","lValueRequested":false,"nodeType":"Literal","src":"1857:1:6","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_rational_1_by_1","typeString":"int_const
